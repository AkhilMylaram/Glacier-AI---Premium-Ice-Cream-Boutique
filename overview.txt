GLACIER AI - POLYGLOT MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

1. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
This project implements a decoupled, distributed system using three different programming languages to leverage their specific strengths:
- Go: High-performance concurrency for the API Gateway.
- Java: Robustness and type-safety for Identity Management (Auth).
- Python: Rapid development and rich ecosystem for the Product Catalog and Logic.

2. SERVICE TOPOLOGY
- API GATEWAY (Go @ 8080): The "Edge" of the system. Routes traffic to internal services.
- AUTH SERVICE (Java @ 3001): Handles secure registration, login, and user profiles.
- CATALOG SERVICE (Python @ 3002): Manages artisanal products, inventory, and transaction history.
- DATABASE (MySQL @ 3306): Shared persistent storage with normalized tables.

3. DATA FLOW

4. KEY FEATURES
- Real-time Voice AI: Integrated directly into the frontend via Gemini Live API.
- Unified Ledger: Orders placed via Python are immediately visible in the Java-authenticated profile.
- Modern Tooling: Java 21 (Virtual Threads ready), Python 3.12 (FastAPI), Go 1.22 (Standard Library Proxy).
